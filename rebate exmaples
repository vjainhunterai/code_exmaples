Example 1: Sales-Based Rebate with an Exception for High Sales Volume
Scenario:
Rebate Program: A standard rebate program offers a 2.5% rebate on the difference between current year and previous year sales for a contract. The threshold for eligibility is $500,000.
Exception: If a sale exceeds $1 million, the rebate increases to 3.5%.
Steps:
Standard Rebate Calculation:

Previous Year Sales: $500,000
Current Year Sales: $900,000
Eligible Rebate Amount: $900,000 - $500,000 = $400,000
Standard Rebate: $400,000 * 2.5% = $10,000
High Volume Exception:

One sale in the current year was for $1.2 million.
The system applies the 3.5% rebate to this sale due to the exception.
Rebate Calculation for Exception Sale: $1,200,000 - $500,000 = $700,000 * 3.5% = $24,500

Example 2: Product-Based Rebate with an Exclusion for a Specific Product
Scenario:
Rebate Program: A product-based rebate program offers a 5% rebate on all sales of specific products under a contract.
Exception: One product (Product ABC) is excluded from the rebate.
Steps:
Standard Rebate Calculation:

Product XYZ Sales: $100,000
Rebate Calculation: $100,000 * 5% = $5,000
Product Exclusion:

Product ABC is excluded, so no rebate is calculated for sales of this product.

Example 3: Sales-Based Rebate with a Custom Threshold Exception
Scenario:
Rebate Program: A rebate program gives a 2% rebate on the difference between previous year and current year sales, with a threshold of $300,000.
Exception: A custom threshold of $200,000 applies for specific sales made after September 2024.
Steps:
Standard Rebate Calculation:

Previous Year Sales: $400,000
Current Year Sales (August 2024): $600,000
Rebate Calculation: ($600,000 - $400,000) * 2% = $4,000 (standard threshold of $300,000).
Custom Threshold Exception:

For a sale made in October 2024, the custom threshold of $200,000 applies.
Current Year Sales (October 2024): $700,000
Rebate Calculation (with custom threshold): ($700,000 - $400,000) * 2% = $6,000.
